I am striving for medical image ubiquity.
I believe that access to medical imaging scanners should be as universal as access to thermometers.
Towards this, I am passionate about medical image restoration, harmonization, representation, and robust analysis.
Recent developments in generative AI have opened up opportunities in addressing these tasks, but there is still work to be done to provide guarantees around this new technology.
