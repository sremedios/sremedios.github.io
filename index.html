        <b>About me</b>
        </br>
        I am interested in signal processing and machine learning techniques related to medical image acquisition, 
        reconstruction, and representation. My current project focuses on super-resolution of anisotropic MRI volumes,
        facilitated by filter bank theory. Ultimately I am interested in techniques for arbitrary signal sampling and
        reconstruction, since the physical world is continuous yet we must store it digitally to leverage computational
        advances.

        Before academia, I tried for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Lop6AaX3k">"rock star dream"</a> 
        full-time with my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=r6HOOmgAAAAJ">brother</a> for 
        several years, recording a couple of professionally produced records in Nashville and some cross-country tours. 
        I still sing and play every day, so not sure whether I fully got it all out of my system. To me, there's still 
        a surprising similarity between playing music and workout out research problems in code or math. In music, it's 
        beneficial to listen to a wide variety of genres, and the artist eventually becomes a unique, individualistic 
        weighted sum of everything they've heard. I think the same is true for research; pulling ideas and techniques 
        from different fields seems to give unique perspectives on problem solving. I get the same kinds of feel-good 
        brain chemicals from both of these domains.
